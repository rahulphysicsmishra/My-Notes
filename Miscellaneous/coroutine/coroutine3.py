"""
Coroutines can be used to set pipes. We can chain together coroutines and push data through pipe using send() method. A pipe needs :

An initial source(producer) which derives the whole pipe line. Producer is usually not a coroutine, itâ€™s just a simple method.
A sink, which is the end point of the pipe. A sink might collect all data and display it.
